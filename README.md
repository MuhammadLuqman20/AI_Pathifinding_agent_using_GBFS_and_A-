# Dynamic Pathfinding Agent

A Python project implementing **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)** and **A*** algorithms with **Manhattan** and **Euclidean** heuristics.  
Supports dynamic obstacles, real-time re-planning, and an interactive **Pygame GUI**.

## Features

- **Search algorithms:** A* and GBFS  
- **Heuristics:** Manhattan & Euclidean  
- **Dynamic obstacles:** Obstacles can appear during execution  
- **Interactive grid editor:** Place walls, set start and goal positions  
- **Step-by-step visualization:** Watch the search expand in real-time  
- **Dynamic mode:** Agent re-plans path when new obstacles appear
